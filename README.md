# Spider

## Server

#### Prerequisites

  To compile and use this project, you'll need:
  - A compiler that suports C++11 (gcc or clang)
  - Boost headers
  - mongo-c-driver
  - mongo-cxx-driver

  We currently test the driver with the following configurations:
  - Boost: 1.65
  - mongo-c-driver: 1.8
  - mongo-cxx-driver: 3

#### Installation

  Actually we are not getting a root CMake. We will ask you to compile the msu before the server to be able to run the server.
